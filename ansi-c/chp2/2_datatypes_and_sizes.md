# Data Types and Sizes

* 8 bits = 1 byte
* types are char (8 bits), int (16 bits), float (16 bits), double (32 bits)
* short is often 16 bits long
* int is either 16 or 32 bits depending on the machine
* signed and unsigned are called qualifiers and limit the space of the variable
* unsigned numbers are always positive or 0
* standard headers <limits.h> and <float.h> contain symbolic constants for all the type sizes

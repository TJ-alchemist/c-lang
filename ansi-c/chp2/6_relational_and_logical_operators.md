# Relational and Logical operators

* relational operators have lower precedence than arithmetic operators
* the relational operators are >, >=, <, <=
* == and != (also known as equality operators) have lower precedence than >, >=, <, <=
* the precedence of && is greater than ||, but both are lower than relational and equality operators
* precedence of equality operators is greater than assignment operators
* the numeric value of a relational or logical expression is 1 if the relation is true, and 0 if the relation is false
* the unary negation operator ! converts a non-zero operand to 0, and a zero operand to 1
